Summary of Technique:
/*
 * In this method we will be generating a new location (z) with a probability (p) that
 * reduces as the distance increase within a certain radius (r).
 *
 * As in Geopriv4j, this algorithm is based on the paper by Andr√©s, Miguel E., et al.
 * "Geo-indistinguishability: Differential privacy for location-based systems."
 * Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSAC conference on Computer & communications
 * security. 2013. https://doi.org/10.1145/2508859.2516735
